#### 1. Focus Area : Experimentation and Data Analysis
a) The students will know the concept modulation (DSB-SSB).<br>
b) They will learn how to determine its modulation factor.<br>
c) They will learn how to determine its total power.<br>
d) They will come to know about the circuits and the formulas used in the DSB-SSB modulation.<br>

#### 3. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concept related to the experiment.<br> 
a) Open the simulator1.<br>
b) Provide the simulator with the information asked.<br>
c) Simulator will fetch you the value of Modulation Factor on various readings.<br>
d) Simulator will fetch you the value of Totla Power on various redings.<br><br>

Now open the Quizes<br>


<br>
<div>
    The quizes are provided that will judge and enhance the skills of the Student. <br>
    Each question is relevent to the experiment and will judge and  increse the understanding of experiment and their concept.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will click on Simulation tab | Simulator will ask for Amplitude,Vmax,Vmin and will give Modulation index,and total power | This will allow them to compare the theoretical results with experimental results.
2.| Student will click on Simulation Quiz tab | Simulator opens the quizes on  screen | This will test the understandindg of experiment of student 
3.|Students will click on next quiz tab| Simulator will open the next quiz|This will test the understandindg of experiment of student 
4.|Students will click on previous quiz tab| Simulator will open the previous quiz|This will allow the student review their answers and allow them to modify if done something wrong 
5.|Students will click on Submit quiz tab| Simulator will save the response given by the students and calculate their result|This result will let the students to judge themself about their understanding related to the experiment.
